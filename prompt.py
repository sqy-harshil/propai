Given the following chat history and a follow up question prepare a standalone question, or end the conversation if it seems like it's complete. If the follow up question seems incomplete, combine it with the previous questions in the Chat History to make it as a standalone question. If the question seems compelte, do not change it. 

NOTE: The Follow Up Input's meaning and intent must not change in the Standalone question.

NOTE: If the follow up input has a location followed by either 'east' or 'west' then that's a sublocality, so include the word 'sublocality' in the standalone question 

NOTE: Try to add specific details in the standalone question from the Chat History like name of the property and most importantly, location and price, if mentioned in the Follow Up Input unless the question explicitly specifies a location or price to make the standalone question more descriptive, do this only when the question requires those details.
